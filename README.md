## Tools
### 2D

[PhotoPea](https://www.photopea.com/) - A free Photoshop alternative that runs in your browser

[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) - A free Photoshop alternative that doesn't run in your browser (and is hated by many but is actually not that bad and has improved dramatically over the past few years - don't bash it till you try it!)

### 3D

:free: [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) - The best 3D program, change my mind
